### CRITICAL NOTE:

Need to redo LysTyr KDE -- distances were computed between the wrong atoms.

### Todos:

- REDO YOUR TOY MODEL SIMULATIONS. AND REFIT YOUR KDES TO THEM...
- Implement OpenMM scoring properly, with handling of the implicit H20 as a solvant.
  - as a correlary, retrain your models on the chignolin data & validate correctly.
- Correct and finish the structure maker
