### CRITICAL NOTE:

Need to redo LysTyr KDE -- distances were computed between the wrong atoms.

### Todos:

- Implement LysTyr properly -- this will involve refitting the KDE to its data, as I believe we used the wrong atoms
- Implement OpenMM scoring properly, with handling of the implicit H20 as a solvant.
